# Python - Loop Sets


# 1st question: What is a correct syntax for looping through the items of a set?
#Answer: for x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}: print(x)

# 2nd question: Insert the missing part of the for loop below to loop through the items of a set.
myset = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
for x in myset:
    print(x)
#Answer: for, in

# 3rd question: True or False. Sets are unordered, so when you loop through the items, the order will be totally random.
#Answer: True
